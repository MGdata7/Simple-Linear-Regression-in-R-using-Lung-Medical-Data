#In this R project I will conduct a simple linear regression using a medical 
#dataset.
#I have a hunch that age will be positively correlated with lung capacity.
#I will use statistical testing to see if my hunch is right.

#First, let's view the data.

```{r}
View(LungCapData)
```

#When designing a test model it's important to know which types of data we are
#working with. Let's call the type or "class" of variable to make sure we're
#on balance.

```{r}
class(Age)
```

```{r}
class(LungCap)
```


#We have continous and discrete numerical data there; all good to move ahead.

#To make sure our model makes sense, let's run a quick data visualisation.

```{r}
plot(Age, LungCap, main ="Age X LungCap Scatterplot")
```


#In the scatterplot we can see a linear trend where age is positiely correlated
#with lung capacity. Note that this is from a study on young people, 
#so it makes sense.

#Let's find the Pearson correlation statistic for this relationship.

```{r}
cor(Age, LungCap)
```


#These variables are strongly positively correlated (0.81).
#Let's label this model for easy use later on.

```{r}
mod <- lm(LungCap ~ Age)
```


#Now let's have a look at the other statistics associated with this calculation.
#This will show us the residuals, the standard error, the multiple R squared 
#adjusted R squared, and the F statistic.

```{r}
summary(mod)
```


#Let's examine the components of our model:

```{r}
attributes(mod)
```


#And let's say we JUST wanted to look at the coefficients in our test results:

```{r}
mod$coefficients
```


#R also has this other syntax for the same function:

```{r}
coef(mod)
```


#On our visualisation, let's now edit the graphics by adding a 
#regression line and making it red and a bit wider.

```{r}
plot(Age, LungCap, main ="Age X LungCap Scatterplot")
abline(mod, col=2, lwd=3)
```

#Next, let's examine the confidence intervals for our model coefficients.

```{r}
confint(mod)
```


#Now let's explore the same data with changed confidence intervals:


```{r}
confint(mod, level=.098)
```

#We can quickly call the Anaylsis of Variance table as well:

```{r}
anova(mod)
```


#We have determined using linear regression that among this group of participants, lung capacity is strongly positively correlated with age. Thanks for reading!
